- 👋 Hi, my name is Raúl and currently I'm a senior physics and astronomy student. This profile was originally made to work collaboratively during an internship I had at ESO, currently I don't use it anymore but have plans to.  
- 👀 Following the template I should talk about my interests, and that'd be astronomy (unexpected I know), and a lot of things that are not that relevant to this profile thing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Galactic astronomy and machine learning methods, as I'm doing my bachelors thesis and it's on those topics, enjoying it a lot!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people that's into machine learning applied to astronomy, not looking for a particular field in astronomy at the moment, just want to explore ML 
- 📫 Reach me at raul.miranda@alumnos.ucn.cl


quick update: got my degree! 😁🎓
